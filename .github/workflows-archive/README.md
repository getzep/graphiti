# Archived Workflows

These workflows are retained for historical/debug reference and are intentionally **not** part of canonical PR CI.

Archived files:
- `lint.yml`
- `typecheck.yml`
- `unit_tests.yml`

## Canonical PR CI Workflows

Use these instead:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/migration-sync-tooling.yml`

## Policy

- Do **not** re-enable archived workflows for routine PR gating.
- If a workflow is revived for a one-off incident, copy it back explicitly and document why in PR notes.
