SONG: ALEXANDER HAMILTON
BURR
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a
Forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence
Impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
LAURENS
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a
Trading charter
JEFFERSON
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter
MADISON
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain
BURR
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world is gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”
HAMILTON
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there’s a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait, just you wait…
ELIZA
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick
COMPANY
And Alex got better but his mother went quick
WASHINGTON
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin’ but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
WASHINGTON
“You gotta fend for yourself.”	COMPANY
“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”
WASHINGTON
He started retreatin’ and readin’ every treatise on the shelf
BURR
There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin’, clerkin’ for his late mother’s landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin’ for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin’ for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man
COMPANY
Scammin’
Plannin’
Oooh…
COMPANY
In New York you can
Be a new man—
In New York you can
Be a new man—
HAMILTON
Just you wait!
Just you wait!

In New York you can be a new man—

Alexander Hamilton
We are waiting in the wings for you
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh
BURR
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Another immigrant
Comin’ up from the bottom
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him	COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton
Waiting in the wings for you
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
Alexander Hamilton…
America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?

There’s a million things I haven’t done

Alexander Hamilton!
SONG: AARON BURR, SIR
COMPANY
1776. New York City
HAMILTON
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?
BURR
That depends. Who’s asking?
HAMILTON
Oh, well, sure, sir
I’m Alexander Hamilton, I’m at your service, sir
I have been looking for you
BURR
I’m getting nervous
HAMILTON
Sir…
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It’s a blur, sir. He handles the financials?
BURR
You punched the bursar
HAMILTON
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I’m not stupid
So how’d you do it? How’d you graduate so fast?
BURR
It was my parents’ dying wish before they passed
HAMILTON
You’re an orphan. Of course! I’m an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we’re worth more
Than anyone bargained for…
BURR
Can I buy you a drink?
HAMILTON
That would be nice
BURR
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less
HAMILTON
What?
BURR
Smile more
HAMILTON
Ha
BURR
Don’t let them know what you’re against or what you’re for
HAMILTON
You can’t be serious
BURR
You wanna get ahead?
HAMILTON
Yes
BURR
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead
LAURENS
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?
LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
Show time!
BURR
…like I said…
LAURENS
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I’m John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o’ Sam Adams, but I’m workin’ on three, uh!
Those redcoats don’t want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I’m free!
LAFAYETTE
Oui oui, mon ami, je m’appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say “Bonsoir!”
Tell the King “Casse toi!” Who’s the best?
C’est moi!
MULLIGAN
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin’ it, yes I heard ya mother said “Come again?”
LAFAYETTE & LAURENS
Ayyyyy
MULLIGAN
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It’s hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets…
LAFAYETTE
Wow
LAURENS
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let’s raise a couple more…
LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
To the revolution!
LAURENS
Well, if it ain’t the prodigy of Princeton college!
MULLIGAN
Aaron Burr!
LAURENS
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!
BURR
Good luck with that: you’re takin’ a stand
You spit. I’m ‘a sit. We’ll see where we land
LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
Boooo!
LAURENS
Burr, the revolution’s imminent. What do you stall for?
HAMILTON
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you fall for?
LAURENS
Ooh
Who are you?	MULLIGAN
Ooh
Who are you?	LAFAYETTE
Ooh
Who are you?
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS
Ooh, who is this kid? What’s he gonna do?
College
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I’m a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin’ to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev’ry burden, ev’ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don’t have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it’s getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the—
HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R—we are—meant to be…
HAMILTON
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin’ on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain’t ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!
LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS
(He says in parentheses)
HAMILTON
Don’t be shocked when your hist’ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you’ll see my ascendancy
HAMILTON
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, I’m just like my country
I’m young, scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwing away my shot
LAURENS
My shot!
My shot!
And I’m not throwing away my shot.
HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I’m just like my country
I’m young, scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwing away my shot
It’s time to take a shot!
LAFAYETTE
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, ‘anarchy?’
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my—
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
Shot!
MULLIGAN
Yo, I’m a tailor’s apprentice
And I got y’all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I’m joining the rebellion cuz I know it’s my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin’ some pants!
I’m gonna take a—
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
Shot!
LAURENS
But we’ll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another—
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
Shot!
BURR
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I’m with you, but the situation is fraught
You’ve got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you’re gonna get shot!
HAMILTON
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let’s hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin’ the pot…
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin’ a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!
Oh, am I talkin’ too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I’ll make y’all proud
LAURENS
Let’s get this guy in front of a crowd
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ENSEMBLE
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I’m just like my country
I’m young, scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I’m just like my country
I’m young, scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwing away my shot

HAMILTON
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When’s it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin’, do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I’d live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin’ fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that’s plenty
Scratch that
This is not a moment, it’s the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin’
But Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’
I’ve been readin’ ‘n writin’
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What’s the state of our nation?
I’m past patiently waitin’. I’m passionately
Smashin’ every expectation
Every action’s an act of creation!
I’m laughin’ in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow

About Congress?!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Verse1: KING GEORGE
You say
The price of my love’s not a price that you’re willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you’re making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I’m your man
You’ll be back, soon you’ll see
You’ll remember you belong to me
You’ll be back, time will tell
You’ll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!
Chorus: KING GEORGE
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da…
Verse2: KING GEORGE
You say our love is draining and you can’t go on
You’ll be the one complaining when I am gone…
And no, don’t change the subject
Cuz you’re my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever…
Verse3: KING GEORGE
You’ll be back like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love, for your praise
And I’ll love you till my dying days
When you’re gone, I’ll go mad
So don’t throw away this thing we had
Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Chorus: KING GEORGE
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!

But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go…

Permission to state my case?

I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west
WASHINGTON
Yes?
BURR
Well—
HAMILTON
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?
WASHINGTON
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?
HAMILTON
Yes, sir
HAMILTON AND BURR
We keep meeting
BURR
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out
WASHINGTON
Burr?
BURR
Sir?
WASHINGTON
Close the door on your way out
HAMILTON
Have I done something wrong, sir?
WASHINGTON
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh
HAMILTON
Sir?
WASHINGTON
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?
HAMILTON
Sir!
WASHINGTON
Don’t get me wrong, you’re a young man of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you…
HAMILTON
To be their Secretary? I don’t think so
WASHINGTON
Why’re you upset?
HAMILTON
I’m not—
WASHINGTON
It’s alright, you want to fight, you’ve got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin’ like a martyr?
HAMILTON
Yes
WASHINGTON
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder
HAMILTON
Why are you telling me this?
WASHINGTON
I’m being honest
I’m working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Ayo, I’m just like my country, I’m young
Scrappy and hungry!
HAMILTON
I am not throwing away my shot!

WASHINGON AND COMPANY
We are outgunned, outmanned!
HAMILTON
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?
WASHINGTON AND COMPANY
Outnumbered, outplanned!
HAMILTON
We’ll need some spies on the inside
Some King’s men who might let some things slide
HAMILTON
I’ll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise
I’ll rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother

Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m helpless!
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em
ELIZA
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!”
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume
ELIZA AND WOMEN
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
ELIZA
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, “Yo, this
One’s mine.”
My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking “What’s she gonna do?”
She grabbed you by the arm, I’m thinkin’ “I’m through”
Then you look back at me and suddenly I’m
Helpless!
Oh, look at those eyes
Oh!
Yeah, I’m
Helpless, I know
I’m so into you

My father’s stone-faced
While you’re asking for his blessin’
I’m dying inside, as
You wine

‘cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do
My father makes his way across the room

I panic for a second, thinking
“we’re through”
But then he shakes your hand and says
“Be true”
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m

Eliza, I don’t have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
And long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God
You’ll never feel so…

I’ve never felt so—
My life is gon’ be fine cuz Eliza’s in it.

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place
But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
FULL COMPANY
This is not a game…

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
ANGELICA
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself

You’re like me. I’m never satisfied

Is that right?
HAMILTON
I have never been satisfied
ANGELICA
My name is Angelica Schuyler
HAMILTON
Alexander Hamilton
ANGELICA
Where’s your fam’ly from?
HAMILTON
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait…
ANGELICA
So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is…
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And I know she is…
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And her eyes are just…

Helpless…

Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…
HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?
ANGELICA
I’m about to change your life
HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way
COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)
Number one!
ANGELICA
I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less
ELIZA
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you
HAMILTON
Schuyler?
ANGELICA
My sister
COMPANY
Number two!
ANGELICA
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
ELIZA
Thank you for all your service
HAMILTON
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it
ANGELICA
I’ll leave you to it
COMPANY
Number three!
ANGELICA
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”
ANGELICA AND COMPANY
She’d be lying
ANGELICA
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…
ANGELICA
To the groom!

Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.
HAMILTON
The war’s not
Done.
HAMILTON
Will you relish being a poor man’s wife
Unable to provide for your life?
ELIZA
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around…
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges you’re facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough
We don’t need a legacy
We don’t need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart…
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?

Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

Ev’ry American experiment sets a precedent
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system

Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you’re here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???
The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton’s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir
JEFFERSON
‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em
Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em

Oww

But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state’s debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits
HAMILTON
Not true!
JEFFERSON
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New York’s in debt—
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I’m afraid
Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky
CROWD (reacting)
That's my alcohol!
 	WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
Secretary Hamilton, your response
HAMILTON
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, we’re running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor
“We plant seeds in the South. We create.”
Yeah, keep ranting
We know who’s really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t fight in it
You think I’m frightened of you, man?
We almost died in a trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison
Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin’ there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, I’ll show you

Un deux trois quatre cinq!
HAMILTON
What!
Uh-huh!
Okay!
Bravo!
ELIZA
Take a break
HAMILTON
Hey, our kid is pretty great
ELIZA
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate
HAMILTON
Eliza, I’ve got so much on my plate
ELIZA
We can all go stay with my father
There’s a lake I know…
HAMILTON
I know
ELIZA
In a nearby park
HAMILTON
I’d love to go
ELIZA
You and I can go when the night gets dark…
HAMILTON
I will try to get away
ANGELICA
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don’t stop ‘til you agree
Your fav’rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There’s someone in your corner all the way across the sea
In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you’ve consumed my waking days
It says:
HAMILTON/ANGELICA
“My dearest Angelica”
ANGELICA
With a comma after “dearest.” You’ve written
HAMILTON AND ANGELICA
“My dearest, Angelica.”
ANGELICA
Anyway, all this to say
I’m coming home this summer
At my sister’s invitation
I’ll be there with your fam’ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you’re very busy
I know your work’s important
But I’m crossing the ocean and I just can’t wait
HAMILTON AND ANGELICA
You won’t be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…
ELIZA
Alexander, come downstairs. Angelica’s arriving today!
ELIZA
Angelica!
ANGELICA
Eliza!
HAMILTON
The Schuyler sisters!
ANGELICA
Alexander
HAMILTON
Hi
ANGELICA
It’s good to see your face
ELIZA
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family
HAMILTON
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn’t have a real job anyway
ANGELICA
…you’re not joining us? Wait
HAMILTON
I’m afraid I cannot join you upstate
ANGELICA
Alexander, I came all this way
ELIZA
She came all this way—
ANGELICA
All this way—
ELIZA AND ANGELICA
Take a break
HAMILTON
You know I have to get my plan through Congress
ELIZA AND ANGELICA
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate
HAMILTON
I lose my job if I don’t get my plan through Congress
ELIZA AND ANGELICA
We can all go stay with our father
ELIZA
There’s a lake I know
In a nearby park
You and I can go
Take a break and get away—
Let’s go upstate
Where we can stay
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now—
We can go—
When the night gets dark
Take a break.
ANGELICA
I know I’ll miss your face—
Screw your courage to the sticking place—
Eliza’s right—
Take a break
Run away with us for the summer—
Let’s go upstate
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time—
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream—
When the night gets dark
Take a break.
HAMILTON
I have to get my plan through Congress
I can’t stop until I get this plan through Congress
BURR
There’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
There’s trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander’s by himself. I’ll let him tell it
HAMILTON
I hadn’t slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:
MARIA
I know you are a man of honor
I’m so sorry to bother you at home
But I don’t know where to go, and I came here all alone…
HAMILTON
She said:
MARIA
My husband’s doin’ me wrong
Beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me…
Suddenly he’s up and gone
I don’t have the means to go on
HAMILTON
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said
MARIA
You’re too kind, sir
HAMILTON
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:
MARIA
This one’s mine, sir
HAMILTON
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,”
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:
MARIA
Stay?
HAMILTON
Hey…
MARIA
Hey…
HAMILTON
That’s when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don’t know how to
Say no to this
But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”
MARIA
Whoa…
HAMILTON
Nooo, show me how to
HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE
Say no to this
HAMILTON
I don’t know how to
HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE
Say no to this
HAMILTON
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go
ENSEMBLE
Go! Go! Go!
HAMILTON
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say…
ENSEMBLE
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
HAMILTON
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:
JAMES
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to
HAMILTON
Fuuuu—
JAMES
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife
If the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife
HAMILTON
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed “How could you?!” in her face
She said:
MARIA
No, sir!
HAMILTON
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:
MARIA
Please don’t go, sir!
HAMILTON
So was your whole story a setup?
MARIA
I don’t know about any letter!
HAMILTON
Stop crying
Goddamnit, get up!
MARIA
I didn’t know any better
HAMILTON
I am ruined…
MARIA
Please don’t leave me with him helpless
Just give him what he wants and you can have me
Whatever you want,
HAMILTON
I am helpless—how could I do this?
I don’t want you
I don’t want you
MARIA
If you pay
You can stay
Tonight
Helpless
Whoa!
How can you
Say no to this?
HAMILTON
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes.	HAMILTON
I don’t…
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don’t know how to
Say no to this
Cuz the situation’s helpless
And her body’s screaming, “Hell, yes”
No, show me how to
Say no to this
How can I
Say no to this?
There is nowhere I can go
When her body’s on mine I do not say…
MARIA
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
ENSEMBLE
Say no to this!
Say no to this!
Say no to this!
Say no to this!
Go! Go! Go!
No!
ENSEMBLE
Say no to this!
No!
Say no to this!
No!
Say no to this!
No!
Say no to this!
HAMILTON
Say no to this…
I don’t say no to this
There is nowhere I can go.
MARIA
Don’t say no to this
ENSEMBLE
Go go go…
JAMES
So?
HAMILTON
Nobody needs to know
BURR
Ah, Mister Secretary
HAMILTON
Mister Burr, sir
BURR
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?
HAMILTON
No
BURR
You know Clermont Street?
HAMILTON
Yeah
BURR
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure
HAMILTON
Sure
BURR
And all he had to do was die
HAMILTON
That’s a lot less work
BURR
We oughta give it a try
HAMILTON
Ha
BURR
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?
HAMILTON
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you
BURR
Really?
HAMILTON
“Talk less. Smile more.”
BURR
Ha
HAMILTON
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor
BURR
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.
HAMILTON
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner
MADISON
Hamilton!
HAMILTON
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go
BURR
But—
HAMILTON
Decisions are happening over dinner
BURR
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Diametric’ly opposed, foes
BURR
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Previously closed
ENSEMBLE
Bros
BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
And here’s the pièce de résistance:
BURR
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.
ENSEMBLE
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
How the sausage gets made
Assume that it happens
The room where it happens.
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day
In distress ‘n disarray
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Alexander said—
HAMILTON
I’ve nowhere else to turn!
JEFFERSON
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
I approached Madison and said—
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating
BURR
But!
No one else was in—
BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
BURR
No one else was in—
BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
BURR
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss
The pieces that are sacrificed in
Ev’ry game of chesssss
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.
COMPANY
Parties get to yesssss
Ev’ry game of chesssss
Assume that it happens
The room where it happens.
BURR AND COMPANY
Meanwhile—
BURR
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee
COMPANY
Meanwhile—
BURR
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—
Company screams in chaos
BURR
It isn’t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:
MADISON
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words—
JEFFERSON
Oh-ho!
MADISON
A quid pro quo
JEFFERSON
I suppose
MADISON
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?
JEFFERSON
Actually, I would
MADISON
Well, I propose the Potomac
JEFFERSON
And you’ll provide him his votes?
MADISON
Well, we’ll see how it goes
JEFFERSON
Let’s go
BURR
No!
COMPANY
—one else was in
The room where it happened
BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
BURR
My God!
BURR AND COMPANY
In God we trust
But we’ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened
BURR
And no one else was in the room where it happened
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?
HAMILTON
Cuz we’ll have the banks
We’re in the same spot
BURR
You got more than you gave
HAMILTON
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…
HAMILTON AND COMPANY
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!
HAMILTON
God help and forgive me
I wanna build
Something that’s gonna
Outlive me
HAMILTON/JEFFERSON/
MADISON/WASHINGTON
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?
If you stand for nothing
Burr, then what do you fall for?
COMPANY
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?

What do you want?
BURR
I
Wanna be in

BURR
I

In the room where it happens

The art of the compromise—
BURR
Hold your nose and close your eyes
COMPANY
We want our leaders to save the day—
BURR
But we don’t get a say in what they trade away
COMPANY
We dream of a brand new start—
BURR
But we dream in the dark for the most part
BURR AND COMPANY
Dark as a tomb where it happens
BURR
I’ve got to be in
The room…
I’ve got to be…

Oh, I’ve got to be in

PHILIP
Look!
Grandpa’s in the paper!
“War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr”
Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate
ELIZA
Sometimes that’s how it goes
PHILIP
Daddy’s gonna find out any minute
ELIZA
I’m sure he already knows
PHILIP
Further down
PHILIP & ELIZA
Further down
PHILIP
Let’s meet the newest senator from New York
ELIZA
New York
PHILIP & ELIZA
Our senator
HAMILTON
Burr?
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?
BURR
Since being one put me on the up and up again
HAMILTON
No one knows who you are or what you do
BURR
They don’t need to know me
They don’t like you
HAMILTON
Excuse me?
BURR
Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great
You’ll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate—
HAMILTON
Wait
BURR
—people think you’re crooked
Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs so I took it
HAMILTON
I’ve always considered you a friend
BURR
I don’t see why that has to end
HAMILTON
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law
BURR
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall
WASHINGTON
The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England, and do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it? Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval. The only person you have to convince is me. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir
JEFFERSON
When we were on death’s door, when we were needy
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
We needed money and guns and half a chance
Who provided those funds?
MADISON
France
JEFFERSON
In return, they didn’t ask for land
Only a promise that we’d lend a hand
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate
I’ll remind you that he is not Secretary of State
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation
ENSEMBLE
Ooh!!
JEFFERSON
Hey, and if ya don’t know, now ya know, Mr. President
WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response
HAMILTON
You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
“Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’ head?”
“Uh… do whatever you want, I’m super dead.”
WASHINGTON
Enough. Hamilton is right
JEFFERSON
Mr. President—
WASHINGTON
We’re too fragile to start another fight
JEFFERSON
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?
WASHINGTON
Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em
JEFFERSON
The people are leading—
WASHINGTON
The people are rioting
There’s a difference. Frankly, it’s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
Hamilton
HAMILTON
Sir
WASHINGTON
Draft a statement of neutrality
JEFFERSON
Did you forget Lafayette?
HAMILTON
What?
JEFFERSON
Have you an ounce of regret?
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
Yet in their hour of need, you forget
HAMILTON
Lafayette’s a smart man, he’ll be fine
And before he was your friend, he was mine
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop
Where do we draw the line?
JEFFERSON
So quick-witted
HAMILTON
Alas, I admit it
JEFFERSON
I bet you were quite a lawyer
HAMILTON
My defendants got acquitted
JEFFERSON
Yeah. Well, someone oughta remind you
HAMILTON
What?
JEFFERSON
You’re nothing without Washington behind you
WASHINGTON
Hamilton!
JEFFERSON
Daddy’s calling!
BURR
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
JEFFERSON
Ev’ry action has its equal, opposite reactions
Thanks to Hamilton, our cab’net’s fractured into factions
Try not to crack under the stress, we’re breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we don’t print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is askin’ for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket
JEFFERSON AND BURR
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
Look back at the Bill of Rights
MADISON
Which I wrote
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
The ink hasn’t dried
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
MADISON
So he’s doubled the size of the government
Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size?
BURR
Look in his eyes!
JEFFERSON
See how he lies
MADISON
Follow the scent of his enterprise
JEFFERSON
Centralizing national credit
And making American credit competitive
MADISON
If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it
JEFFERSON
I have to resign
MADISON
Somebody has to stand up for the South!
BURR
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
JEFFERSON
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse
MADISON AND JEFFERSON
You can’t put it out from inside the house
JEFFERSON
I’m in the cabinet. I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen
To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference:
This kid is out!
MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON
Oh!
This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose
Oh!
This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes
Oh!
Let’s show these Federalists who they’re up against!
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON
Southern motherfuckin’—
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Democratic-Republicans!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR/ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Let’s follow the money and see where it goes
ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Because every second the Treasury grows
ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of
Hamilton’s misdeeds
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
It must be nice. It must be nice
MADISON
Follow the money and see where it goes
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
It must be nice. It must be nice
JEFFERSON
The emperor has no clothes
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
We won’t be invisible. We won’t be denied
Still
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
HAMILTON
Mr. President, you asked to see me?
WASHINGTON
I know you’re busy
HAMILTON
What do you need, sir? Sir?
WASHINGTON
I wanna give you a word of warning
HAMILTON
Sir, I don’t know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it
WASHINGTON
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning
HAMILTON
You’re kidding
WASHINGTON
I need a favor
HAMILTON
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior
WASHINGTON
Shh. Talk less
HAMILTON
I’ll use the press
I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what I can do to him—
WASHINGTON
I need you to draft an address
HAMILTON
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind—
WASHINGTON
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for President
HAMILTON
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir
WASHINGTON
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for President
HAMILTON
I’m sorry, what?
WASHINGTON
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let’s take a break tonight
And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I
HAMILTON
No, sir, why?
WASHINGTON
I wanna talk about neutrality
HAMILTON
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time—
WASHINGTON
I want to warn against partisan fighting
HAMILTON
But—
WASHINGTON
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned
HAMILTON
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve—
WASHINGTON
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I—
HAMILTON
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak
WASHINGTON
No, they will see we’re strong
HAMILTON
Your position is so unique
WASHINGTON
So I’ll use it to move them along
HAMILTON
Why do you have to say goodbye?
WASHINGTON
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I’m gone
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we’ve made
One last time
HAMILTON
One last time
HAMILTON
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me
HAMILTON
The hope
That my country will
View them with indulgence;
And that
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
The faults of incompetent abilities will be
Consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.	WASHINGTON

ALL WOMEN
George Washington’s going home!

Teach ‘em how to say goodbye

We’re gonna teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!

KING GEORGE
They say
George Washington’s yielding his power and stepping away
‘Zat true?
I wasn’t aware that was something a person could do
I’m perplexed
Are they gonna keep on replacing whoever’s in charge?
If so, who’s next?
There’s nobody else in their country who looms quite as large…
A sentinel whispers in King George’s ear
John Adams?!
I know him
That can’t be
That’s that little guy who spoke to me
All those years ago
What was it, eighty-five?
That poor man, they’re gonna eat him alive!
Oceans rise
Empires fall
Next to Washington, they all look small
All alone
Watch them run
They will tear each other into pieces
Jesus Christ, this will be fun!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da da dat dat da ya daaaaa!
“President John Adams”
Good Luck
BURR
How does Hamilton the short-tempered
Protean creator of the Coast Guard
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cab’net post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome, folks, to
BURR/COMPANY
The Adams administration!
BURR
Jefferson’s the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President
JEFFERSON
Washington can’t help you now, no more mister nice President
BURR
Adams fires Hamilton
Privately calls him “creole bastard” in his taunts
JEFFERSON
Say what?!
BURR
Hamilton publishes his response
HAMILTON
Sit down, John, you fat mother—BLEEP
BURR
Hamilton is out of control
MADISON
This is great! He’s out of power. He holds no office. And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party
JEFFERSON
Hamilton’s a host unto himself. As long as he can hold a pen, he’s a threat. Let’s let him know what we know
HAMILTON
Mr. Vice President
Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?
JEFFERSON
We have the check stubs. From separate accounts…
MADISON
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts…
BURR
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in
Seventeen ninety-one
HAMILTON
Is that what you have? Are you done?
MADISON
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position—
JEFFERSON
Though ‘virtue’ is not a word I’d apply to this situation—
MADISON
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission—
JEFFERSON
And the evidence suggests you’ve engaged in speculation—
BURR
An immigrant embezzling our government funds—
JEFFERSON/MADISON
I can almost see the headline, your career is done
BURR
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons
BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON

HAMILTON
Ha! You don’t even know what you’re asking me to confess
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Confess
HAMILTON
You have nothing. I don’t have to tell you anything at all
Unless
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Unless
HAMILTON
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?
BURR
No one else was in the room where it happened
HAMILTON
Is that a yes?
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Um, yes
BURR
“Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided to—”
JEFFERSON
Whaaaat—
HAMILTON
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That’s when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered
History. Check it again against your list n’ see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn’t mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that’s fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?
JEFFERSON
My God
MADISON
Gentlemen, let’s go
HAMILTON
So?
JEFFERSON AND MADISON
The people won't know what we know
HAMILTON
Burr!
How do I know you won’t use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?
BURR
Alexander, rumors only grow. And we both
Know what we know
HAMILTON
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky
When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didn’t drown
I couldn’t seem to die
I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me
They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound…
I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky
I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn’t seem to die
BURR
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

I’ll write my way out…
Write ev’rything down, far as I can see…
I’ll write my way out…
Overwhelm them with honesty.

His poor wife
ELIZA
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine
Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said
“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”
You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to
Burn
Burn
You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”
You and your words, obsessed with your legacy…
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you
You, you, you…
I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn

Meet the latest graduate of King’s College!
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brain’s not where the resemblance stops!
I’m only nineteen but my mind is older
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride
I used to hear him say
That someday
I would—
ENSEMBLE
Blow us all away

Ladies, I’m lookin for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my father’s legacy in front of a crowd
I can’t have that, I’m making my father proud

I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goin’ to see a play
PHILIP
Well, I’ll go visit his box

I know where to find you, piss off
I’m watchin’ this show now
PHILIP
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to—
HAMILTON
Slow down
PHILIP
I came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel
They don’t exactly cover this subject in boarding school
HAMILTON
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?
PHILIP
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease
HAMILTON
Where is this happening?
PHILIP
Across the river, in Jersey
HAMILTON/PHILIP
Everything is legal in New Jersey…
HAMILTON
Alright. So this is what you’re gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair
PHILIP
But what if he decides to shoot? Then I’m a goner
HAMILTON
No. He’ll follow suit if he’s truly a man of honor
To take someone’s life, that is something you can’t shake
Philip, your mother can’t take another heartbreak

Promise me. You don’t want this
Young man’s blood on your conscience

Okay, I promise

Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son

I am a poet
I’m a little nervous, but I can’t show it

Yes. But you have to understand

He’d be standing here right now
And you would smile, and that would be enough
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges we’re facing
I know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost
And you need time
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough

BURR AND COMPANY
Number two!
BURR
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew
COMPANY
Number three!
BURR
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!
COMPANY
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!
BURR
Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability
COMPANY
Five!
BURR
Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were—
BURR AND PHILIP
Near the same spot
Your son died, is that
Why—	HAMILTON
Near the same spot
My son died, is that
Why—
COMPANY
Six!

He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger
COMPANY
Seven!
BURR
Confession time? Here’s what I got:
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot
COMPANY
Number eight!
BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight
BURR
They won’t teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter
COMPANY
Number nine!
BURR
Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:
COMPANY
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!—
HAMILTON
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?
Legacy. What is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side
Teach me how to say goodbye
Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza
My love, take your time
I’ll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom…
BURR AND COMPANY
He aims his pistol at the sky—
BURR
Wait!
BURR
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

Angelica and Eliza—
BURR
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I’m the one who paid for it
I survived, but I paid for it
Now I’m the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see…
I should’ve known
I should’ve known
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
