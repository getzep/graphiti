# Maps group_id → lane-specific extraction ontology.
# Each lane defines:
#   entity_types  — what kinds of entities to extract
#   relationship_types — what edges connect those entities
#   extraction_emphasis — free-text prompt guidance for the LLM extractor
#
# group_ids not listed here fall back to the default entity types
# configured in your GraphitiConfig (graphiti.entity_types).

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Lane 1: Customer Support Tickets
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
customer_support_tickets:
  extraction_emphasis: >
    Focus on extracting the customer's core problem, the product
    features involved, resolution steps taken, and whether the issue
    was resolved or escalated. Prioritize actionable patterns over
    one-off complaints.

  entity_types:
    - name: CustomerIssue
      description: >
        A specific problem or complaint reported by a customer.
        Extract the symptom, affected feature, and severity if stated.

    - name: ProductFeature
      description: >
        A product capability, module, or component referenced in the ticket.

    - name: ResolutionStep
      description: >
        An action taken by support staff to diagnose or fix the issue.

    - name: Workaround
      description: >
        A temporary fix or alternative path suggested to the customer.

  relationship_types:
    - name: AFFECTS
      description: "CustomerIssue → ProductFeature it impacts"

    - name: RESOLVED_BY
      description: "CustomerIssue → ResolutionStep that fixed it"

    - name: WORKED_AROUND_BY
      description: "CustomerIssue → Workaround applied"

    - name: ESCALATED_TO
      description: "CustomerIssue → team or tier it was escalated to"

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Lane 2: Product Feedback
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
product_feedback:
  extraction_emphasis: >
    Extract feature requests, usability observations, and sentiment
    signals. Distinguish between explicit requests ("I want X") and
    implicit needs ("I keep having to do Y manually"). Capture the
    user persona or segment when identifiable.

  entity_types:
    - name: FeatureRequest
      description: >
        A specific capability or improvement the user wants.

    - name: UsabilityObservation
      description: >
        A friction point, confusion, or delight moment in the user experience.

    - name: UserPersona
      description: >
        The type of user providing feedback (e.g., power user, new user,
        admin). Extract only when identifiable from context.

    - name: CompetitorMention
      description: >
        A reference to a competing product or alternative tool.

  relationship_types:
    - name: REQUESTED_BY
      description: "FeatureRequest → UserPersona who asked for it"

    - name: OBSERVED_IN
      description: "UsabilityObservation → product area where it occurred"

    - name: COMPARED_TO
      description: "ProductFeature → CompetitorMention"

    - name: BLOCKED_BY
      description: "FeatureRequest → existing limitation or dependency"

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Lane 3: Engineering Incidents
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
engineering_incidents:
  extraction_emphasis: >
    Focus on root causes, blast radius, remediation steps, and
    lessons learned. Extract specific tool/API behaviors that
    contributed to the incident. Prioritize patterns that prevent
    recurrence over narrative details.

  entity_types:
    - name: IncidentReport
      description: >
        A production incident or outage event, including severity and duration.

    - name: RootCause
      description: >
        The underlying technical reason the incident occurred.

    - name: RemediationStep
      description: >
        An action taken to resolve the incident or prevent recurrence.

    - name: AffectedService
      description: >
        A service, component, or system impacted by the incident.

    - name: ToolApiBehavior
      description: >
        A specific tool or API quirk that contributed to the incident
        (e.g., unexpected return value, race condition, config gotcha).

  relationship_types:
    - name: CAUSED_BY
      description: "IncidentReport → RootCause"

    - name: FIXED_BY
      description: "IncidentReport → RemediationStep"
