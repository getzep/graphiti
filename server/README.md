# graph-service

Graph service is a fast api server implementing the [graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) package.

## Container Releases

The FastAPI server container is automatically built and published to Docker Hub when a new `graphiti-core` version is released to PyPI.

**Image:** `zepai/graphiti`

**Available tags:**
- `latest` - Latest stable release
- `0.22.1` - Specific version (matches graphiti-core version)

**Platforms:** linux/amd64, linux/arm64

The automated release workflow:
1. Triggers when `graphiti-core` PyPI release completes
2. Waits for PyPI package availability
3. Builds multi-platform Docker image
4. Tags with version number and `latest`
5. Pushes to Docker Hub

Only stable releases are built automatically (pre-release versions are skipped).

## Running Instructions

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Add `zepai/graphiti:latest` to your service setup

3. Make sure to pass the following environment variables to the service

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NEO4J_USER=your_neo4j_user
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password
   NEO4J_PORT=your_neo4j_port
   ```

4. This service depends on having access to a neo4j instance, you may wish to add a neo4j image to your service setup as well. Or you may wish to use neo4j cloud or a desktop version if running this locally.

   An example of docker compose setup may look like this:

   ```yml
      version: '3.8'

      services:
      graph:
         image: zepai/graphiti:latest
         ports:
            - "8000:8000"
         
         environment:
            - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
            - NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:${NEO4J_PORT}
            - NEO4J_USER=${NEO4J_USER}
            - NEO4J_PASSWORD=${NEO4J_PASSWORD}
      neo4j:
         image: neo4j:5.22.0
         
         ports:
            - "7474:7474"  # HTTP
            - "${NEO4J_PORT}:${NEO4J_PORT}"  # Bolt
         volumes:
            - neo4j_data:/data
         environment:
            - NEO4J_AUTH=${NEO4J_USER}/${NEO4J_PASSWORD}

      volumes:
      neo4j_data:
   ```

5. Once you start the service, it will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port you have specified in the docker compose file).

6. You may access the swagger docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. You may also access redocs at `http://localhost:8000/redoc`.

7. You may also access the neo4j browser at `http://localhost:7474` (the port depends on the neo4j instance you are using).
