  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": {"url": "https://example.com/test", "title": "Test Article", "content": {"text": "This is a test article."}}, "categories": ["Test", "Example"], "source": {"url": "https://example.com/test", "title": "Test Article", "timestamp": "2025-05-21T12:00:00Z"}}'

# Retrieve the saved data
curl "http://localhost:8000/retrieve/episodes?query=Test%20Article"

# Verify the data is correctly stored and retrievable
```

**Verification Criteria:**
- [ ] UI is visually appealing and follows design guidelines
- [ ] All interactive elements work as expected
- [ ] UI provides clear feedback for user actions
- [ ] UI is responsive and adapts to different window sizes
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully

**Verification Test:**
```
# Manual testing checklist:
1. Open the extension popup
2. Verify all sections are visible and properly styled
3. Test each button and interactive element
4. Verify feedback is provided for actions (success/error messages)
5. Test with different window sizes
6. Test error handling by entering invalid data or disconnecting from server
```

## 6. Documentation

- [ ] Code is well-commented and follows documentation standards
- [ ] API endpoints are documented with request/response formats
- [ ] Testing procedures are clearly outlined
- [ ] Architecture and design decisions are explained

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Check documentation files
ls -la browser_agent/README.md browser_agent/FEATURE_README.md browser_agent/TESTING_PLAN.md

# Verify code comments
grep -n "//" browser_agent/*.js | wc -l
grep -n "#" server/graph_service/routers/browser_agent.py | wc -l

# Ensure all files have appropriate documentation
```

## 7. Testing Suite

### Deliverable: Comprehensive testing suite for all components
**Verification Criteria:**
- [ ] Automated tests for server API endpoints
- [ ] Automated tests for browser extension functionality
- [ ] Manual testing procedures documented
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions covered
- [ ] All tests pass successfully

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Run server API tests
python browser_agent/test_server_api.py --url http://localhost:8000

# Run extension tests (in browser console)
# Paste contents of test_extension.js

# Verify all tests pass with success messages
```

## 8. Cross-Browser Compatibility

### Deliverable: Extension works in Chrome and is designed for cross-browser compatibility
**Verification Criteria:**

**Verification Criteria:**
- [ ] Extension requests only necessary permissions
- [ ] Data is transmitted securely (HTTPS)
- [ ] No sensitive data is stored unencrypted
- [ ] User has control over what data is extracted and saved
- [ ] API endpoints implement proper authentication

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Check permissions in manifest

# Verify secure communication
grep -r "https://" browser_agent/*.js

# Test user control features
# Manually verify that users can select which elements to extract
# Verify users can customize categories before saving
```

## 10. Performance

### Deliverable: Efficient and responsive browser agent
**Verification Criteria:**
- [ ] Extension loads quickly (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Data extraction is efficient and doesn't freeze the page
- [ ] API responses are timely (< 5 seconds)
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] No performance degradation with large pages

**Verification Test:**
```bash

# Use Chrome DevTools to measure extension load time

# Test extraction performance
# Extract data from a large web page and measure time
# Verify the page remains responsive during extraction

# Test API response time
time curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/browser_agent/categorize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": {"url": "https://example.com", "title": "Example", "content": {"text": "Sample content"}}}'
```
