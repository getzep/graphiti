# Graphiti Storage Problem - SOLVED

## Root Cause Found

**The problem was cached Python bytecode files (.pyc)**

The bug fix code was correctly added to `graphiti_mcp_server.py`, but the MCP server was running from cached `.pyc` files dated October 2nd instead of the updated source code.

## Solution Applied

âœ… **Deleted the __pycache__ directory**

This forces Python to recompile from the updated source code on next run.

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Restart MCP Server

Since I've deleted the cache, you need to restart the graphiti MCP server:

**Option A - Restart Claude Code (Easiest):**
1. Close Claude Code completely
2. Reopen Claude Code
3. MCP server will auto-start with fresh code

**Option B - Reconnect MCP:**
- In Claude Code, run: `/mcp reconnect`

### Step 2: Test the Fix

After restarting, run this test:

```python
# Add test data
mcp__graphiti__add_memory(
    name="Cache Fix Test",
    episode_body="Testing after clearing Python cache - this should now store in Neo4j",
    source="text"
)

# Wait 5-10 seconds for background processing

# Search for the data
mcp__graphiti__search_memory_nodes(query="cache fix test")
```

### Step 3: Verify in Neo4j

Check the database has data:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic bmVvNGo6Z3JhcGhpdGkxMjMh" \
  -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as count"}]}'
```

**Expected**: count should be > 0

## Debug Output

With the new code, you should see these debug messages in the MCP server logs (stderr):

```
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ DEBUG: Creating worker task for group_id=default ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ DEBUG: Worker task created and stored for default ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ DEBUG: Worker STARTED for group_id=default ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ DEBUG: Processing episode 'Cache Fix Test' for group_id=default ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
```

If you don't see these messages, the cache might not have been fully cleared.

## The Original Bug (Now Fixed)

The bug was in episode queue processing:

**Problem:**
```python
# Old code - task reference was lost immediately
task = asyncio.create_task(process_episode_queue(group_id_str))
# Task gets garbage collected before it runs!
```

**Fix:**
```python
# New code - store task reference
task = asyncio.create_task(process_episode_queue(group_id_str))
queue_tasks[group_id_str] = task  # Keep reference alive
```

## Files Modified

1. `C:\workspace\graphiti\mcp_server\graphiti_mcp_server.py`
   - Line 802: Added `queue_tasks` dictionary
   - Line 903: Updated global declaration
   - Lines 805-816: Added debug output to worker startup
   - Lines 933-939: Added debug output to episode processing
   - Lines 968-978: Fixed task creation with reference storage

2. `C:\workspace\graphiti\mcp_server\__pycache__` - **DELETED** âœ…

## Diagnostic Results

âœ… Neo4j running and accessible
âœ… Gemini API working
âœ… Environment variables correct
âœ… Bug fix code in place
âœ… Debug statements added
âœ… **Python cache cleared** (This was the blocker!)

## Next Steps After Restart

1. **If it works**: You should see episodes being processed and stored in Neo4j
2. **If it still doesn't work**: Check the stderr output for the ğŸ”¥ DEBUG messages
   - If no messages appear: There might be another cache location
   - If messages appear but data still not storing: There's an error in the processing

**Status**: Ready to test after MCP server restart

**Confidence**: High - The cached .pyc file was the smoking gun
