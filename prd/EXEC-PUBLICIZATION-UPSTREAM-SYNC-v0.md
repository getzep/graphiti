# DEPRECATED: Publicization + Upstream Sync + Write-up Asset Prep v0

Superseded by:
- `prd/EPIC-PUBLICIZATION-UPSTREAM-SYNC-SIMPLIFICATION-v1.md`

And child execution PRDs:
- `prd/EXEC-PUBLIC-FOUNDATION-BOUNDARY-CONTRACT-v1.md`
- `prd/EXEC-PUBLIC-REFACTOR-PASS-SIMPLIFY-v1.md`
- `prd/EXEC-PUBLIC-HISTORY-MIGRATION-CUTOVER-v1.md`
- `prd/EXEC-UPSTREAM-SYNC-LANE-v1.md`
- `prd/EXEC-PACK-ADAPTER-INTERFACE-CONTRACT-v1.md`
- `prd/EXEC-STATE-MIGRATION-KIT-v1.md`
- `prd/EXEC-PUBLIC-DOCS-RELEASE-RAILS-v1.md`
- `prd/EXEC-PUBLICIZATION-INTEGRATION-E2E-v1.md`

Reason: scope expanded to a full Epic with explicit DAG, migration strategy scorecard, and simplicity-first refactor pass.
