# PRD: Adapter Wiring (Public Template)

This file is retained as a **public template placeholder**.

The original execution PRD referenced private workflow/consumer mappings that are now maintained in private overlay repositories.

## Public guidance
- Keep generic router framework code in this repository.
- Keep only example pack/profile mappings in this repository.
- Store real operational mappings and environment-specific runbooks in a private overlay repository.

See `docs/runbooks/runtime-pack-overlay.md` for the active split model.
