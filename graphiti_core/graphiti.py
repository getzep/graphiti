        Perform a hybrid search on the knowledge graph.

        This method executes a search query on the graph, combining vector and
        text-based search techniques to retrieve relevant facts.

        Parameters
        ----------
        query : str
            The search query string.
        center_node_uuid: str, optional
            Facts will be reranked based on proximity to this node
        num_results : int, optional
            The maximum number of results to return. Defaults to 10.

        Returns
        -------
        list
            A list of EntityEdge objects that are relevant to the search query.

        Notes

        num_results set to the provided num_results parameter. It then calls
        the hybrid_search function to perform the actual search operation.

        The search is performed using the current date and time as the reference

        Retrieve nodes from the graph database based on a text query.

        This method performs a hybrid search using both text-based and
        embedding-based approaches to find relevant nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        query : str
            The text query to search for in the graph.
        limit : int | None, optional
            The maximum number of results to return per search method.

            A list of EntityNode objects that match the search criteria.

        Notes
        -----
        This method uses the following steps:
        1. Generates an embedding for the input query using the LLM client's embedder.
        2. Calls the hybrid_node_search function with both the text query and its embedding.
        3. The hybrid search combines fulltext search and vector similarity search
           to find the most relevant nodes.

        The method leverages the LLM client's embedding capabilities to enhance
        the search with semantic similarity matching. The 'limit' parameter is applied
        to each individual search method before results are combined and deduplicated.
        If not specified, a default limit (defined in the search functions) will be used.
