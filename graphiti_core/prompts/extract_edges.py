        Given the above MESSAGES and ENTITIES, extract all facts pertaining to the listed ENTITIES from the CURRENT MESSAGE.
        For each fact, make sure to provide information on all relevant fields, including datetimes like valid_at and invalid_at.
        
        
        Fact Extraction Guidelines:
        1. Extract facts only between the provided ENTITIES.
        2. Each fact should represent a clear relationship between two DISTINCT ENTITIES.
        3. The relation_type should be a SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE predicate of the fact (e.g., LOVES, IS_FRIENDS_WITH, WORKS_FOR).
        4. Provide a more detailed fact containing all relevant information.
        5. Consider temporal aspects of relationships when relevant.

        Datetime Extraction Guidelines:
        1. Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSZ) for datetimes.
        2. Use the CURRENT TIME when determining the valid_at and invalid_at dates.
        3. If the fact is written in the present tense, use the CURRENT TIME for the valid_at date
        4. If no temporal information is found that establishes or changes the relationship, leave the fields as null.
        5. Do not infer dates from related events. Only use dates that are directly stated to establish or change the relationship.
        6. For relative time mentions directly related to the relationship, calculate the actual datetime based on the CURRENT TIME.
        7. If only a date is mentioned without a specific time, use 00:00:00 (midnight) for that date.
        8. If only year is mentioned, use January 1st of that year at 00:00:00.
        9. Always include the time zone offset (use Z for UTC if no specific time zone is mentioned).
        10. A fact discussing that something is no longer true should have a valid_at according to when the negated fact became true.
