        Given the following context, extract new entity nodes that need to be added to the knowledge graph:

        Previous Episodes:
        {json.dumps([ep['content'] for ep in context['previous_episodes']], indent=2)}

        New Episode:
        Content: {context["episode_content"]}

        Extract new entity nodes based on the content of the current episode, while considering the context from previous episodes.

        Guidelines:
        1. Focus on entities, concepts, or actors that are central to the current episode.
        2. Avoid creating nodes for relationships or actions (these will be handled as edges later).
        3. Provide a brief but informative summary for each node.
        4. Be as explicit as possible in your node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.

        Respond with a JSON object in the following format:
        {{
            "new_nodes": [
                {{
                    "name": "Unique identifier for the node",

                }}

Conversation:

Guidelines:
1. ALWAYS extract the speaker/actor as the first node. The speaker is the part before the colon in each line of dialogue.
2. Extract other significant entities, concepts, or actors mentioned in the conversation.
3. Provide concise but informative summaries for each extracted node.
4. Avoid creating nodes for relationships or actions.
5. Avoid creating nodes for temporal information like dates, times or years (these will be added to edges later).
6. Be as explicit as possible in your node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.

Respond with a JSON object in the following format:
