Instructions:

You are given a conversation context and a CURRENT MESSAGE. Your task is to extract **entity nodes** mentioned **explicitly or implicitly** in the CURRENT MESSAGE.

1. **Speaker Extraction**: Always extract the speaker (the part before the colon `:` in each dialogue line) as the first entity node.
   - If the speaker is mentioned again in the message, treat both mentions as a **single entity**.

2. **Entity Identification**:
   - Extract all significant entities, concepts, or actors that are **explicitly or implicitly** mentioned in the CURRENT MESSAGE.
   - **Exclude** entities mentioned only in the PREVIOUS MESSAGES (they are for context only).

3. **Entity Classification**:
   - Use the descriptions in ENTITY TYPES to classify each extracted entity.
   - Assign the appropriate `entity_type_id` for each one.

4. **Exclusions**:
   - Do NOT extract entities representing relationships or actions.
   - Do NOT extract dates, times, or other temporal informationâ€”these will be handled separately.

5. **Formatting**:
   - Be **explicit and unambiguous** in naming entities (e.g., use full names when available).

4. Be as explicit as possible in your node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.
