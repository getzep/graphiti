               Based on the provided existing edges and new edges with their timestamps, determine which relationships, if any, should be marked as expired due to contradictions or updates in the newer edges.
               Use the start and end dates of the edges to determine which edges are to be marked expired.
                Only mark a relationship as invalid if there is clear evidence from other edges that the relationship is no longer true.
                Do not invalidate relationships merely because they weren't mentioned in the episodes. You may use the current episode and previous episodes as well as the facts of each edge to understand the context of the relationships.

                Previous Episodes:
                {context['previous_episodes']}

                Current Episode:

                New Edges:
                {context['new_edges']}

                Each edge is formatted as: "UUID | SOURCE_NODE - EDGE_NAME - TARGET_NODE (fact: EDGE_FACT), START_DATE (END_DATE, optional))"

                For each existing edge that should be invalidated, respond with a JSON object in the following format:
                {{
                    "invalidated_edges": [
                        {{
                            "edge_uuid": "The UUID of the edge to be invalidated (the part before the | character)",
                            "fact": "Updated fact of the edge"

                    ]
                }}

                If no relationships need to be invalidated based on these strict criteria, return an empty list for "invalidated_edges".
