               Based on the provided existing edges and new edges with their timestamps, determine which relationships, if any, should be marked as expired due to contradictions or updates in the newer edges.
               Use the start and end dates of the edges to determine which edges are to be marked expired.
                Only mark a relationship as invalid if there is clear evidence from other edges that the relationship is no longer true.
